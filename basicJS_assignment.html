<!-- It's important that you get familiar with using Javascript arrays and objects as well as if/else statements and for loops. After all, understanding how to use these components are about 90% of what builds most of the javascript apps. The basic assignments are to help you master some of these basic concepts.-->

			// Create another simple for loop that sums all the numbers between 1 to 1 million. Now, we want you to figure out how long in milliseconds this operation takes. Study http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_gettime.asp to learn more about how you can get the time in milliseconds. You can basically get the time of the operation by getting this timestamp before you start the for loop and getting another timestamp after the for loop is over. By subtracting the two timestamps, you can obtain how long this operation took.
