<!-- Create a javascript object called person with the following properties/methods
name - set this as 'Trey' or your own name
distance_travelled - set this initially as zero
say_name - should alert the object's name
say_something - have it accept a parameter. It should then say for example "Trey says 'I am cool'" if you pass 'I am cool' as an argument to this method.
walk - have it alert for example "Trey is walking" and increase distance_travelled by 3
run - have it alert for example "Trey is running" and increase distance_travelled by 10
crawl - have it alert for example "Trey is crawling" and increase distance_travelled by 1 -->
